# Website
My personal portfolio website.
 
The main purpose of this website is to show off my development skills in CSS, HTML and JS. It will include a range of my projects from GitHub including statistics as to how many commits, pushes and pulls I have made. This way prospective employers, universities and much more can see the type of work and projects I am creating.
